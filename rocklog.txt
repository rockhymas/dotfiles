Just finished my daily web timebox

[2011-05-13 Fri 02:09 PM]
Trying to import another time, customer db that imported without primary keys

[2011-05-13 Fri 02:46 PM]
Installing sql server 2005 so I can try importing the db to that

[2011-05-13 Fri 03:43 PM]
Spent the last 40 minutes or so discussing the new design changes that Justin is working on. They're looking really cool.

[2011-05-16 Mon 09:30 AM]
In to work, going to plan my day out

[2011-05-16 Mon 10:07 AM]
Playing with BugMonkey and the filter menu

[2011-05-16 Mon 11:06 AM]
Finished fixing the filter menu, learned some new jQuery, now it's time to look at the release status for today
We have jQuery 1.3 in FogBugz. We should really upgrade to 1.6 at some point soon

[2011-05-16 Mon 11:08 AM]
Ok, release is looking good, assuming QA passes off on it by eod. Now I'm going to process my undecided cases, trying to get things in a good state for the internship.

[2011-05-16 Mon 12:25 PM]
Time for my web timebox.

[2011-05-16 Mon 02:26 PM]
Talked with Aaron re new bug filing plan. We agreed that it makes sense to have him help with the main thrust for the summer: UI Refresh. Then we talked about having him help both interns, which he agreed to do. So we walked through things with him and Justin. I'll be the protection for the summer - inbox cases, random bugs, etc. I was also very impressed with his perception on the product. I think he could take over as FogBugz lead if need be.

[2011-05-16 Mon 02:28 PM]
Now I'm restarting heartbeat to unblock test accounts, which aren't getting heartbeat.

[2011-05-16 Mon 03:47 PM]
Just fixed a case filed by support on mysql performance. Verified that behavior is unchanged. Did not verify that performance improved.

[2011-05-16 Mon 04:02 PM]
Looking at an IE9 bug with sizing the case view

[2011-05-17 Tue 09:25 AM]
Just got in, doing my morning planning

[2011-05-17 Tue 09:44 AM]
Clearing out old bugzscout reports

[2011-05-17 Tue 09:56 AM]
Going back and forth to help Kiln fix the break that happened with last night's release. They'd like to go back to 2.4, if possible. That would require building and deploying a new version of FogBugz 8.5 with the Kiln 2.4 plugin. Then we manually reset people's Kiln version to 2.4, and update the hosted metabase accordingly. Seems risky, but another option would be to change the default generation back to 2.4.112, if that will help with new signups.

[2011-05-17 Tue 01:55 PM]
Fixing up my FogBugz ui some more with BugMonkey

[2011-05-18 Wed 09:30 AM]
Starting the day with planning

[2011-05-18 Wed 09:52 AM]
Stopped weird qany1 error reports by turning heartbeat off

[2011-05-19 Thu 10:23 AM]
Spent the last 30 minutes looking into a weird bug with the size of the filter by project dropdown (in ondemand, not in ourdot)

[2011-05-20 Fri 09:16 AM]
Into work, planning my day

[2011-05-23 Mon 09:08 AM]
Just got in, writing my weekly kiwi

[2011-05-23 Mon 09:34 AM]
Finished weekly kiwi, Now I'm going to document the downgrade steps for a customer, from 8.4 to 8.2

[2011-05-23 Mon 10:51 AM]
Just talked with Rob about the inbox case (null schema one), here's hoping it's related to the attachment/indexfilepage perf improvements I wrote up last week

[2011-05-23 Mon 11:07 AM]
Shared my "new nav bar" bugmonkey script in the kiwi house, so we can get feedback

[2011-05-23 Mon 11:25 AM]
Trying to track down why hosted bugzscout reports aren't happening

[2011-05-24 Tue 01:04 PM]
This morning I:
    Looked into lookbooks issue where their filters were getting messed up. Loooking at logs shows that api calls are changing the default filter for the user. 
    Helped Benjamin get things on track for bumping hosted test accounts.
    Talked with babak about the rollout.
    Got caught up on the errors from last night. Something got messed up on hbny2 that was causing regular crashes. Babak fixed it, and we still have one account that is not being heartbeat because it brings down IIS. 

[2011-05-25 Wed 02:05 PM]
Spent the morning on two inbox cases. 
    1) Was to get the Frogger db setup so it could imported for a hosted customer who wants to use it for demos
    2) Try to figure out why wtw's hosted account is bringing down IIS. I tried to collect crash dumps, call stacks, etc. No cigar. 
Next step on 2 is to get a hosted dev environment setup so I can debug this one account. That's a lot of work, but I should really have it setup anyway.

[2011-05-26 Thu 09:23 AM]
Just got in, looked at some cases. Now I'm going to work some more on the wtw issue.

[2011-05-26 Thu 02:34 PM]
Ok, fixed the wtw issue, deployed a new gen, now need to move test accounts to it. Also helped Ben track down an issue with the upgradeservice that was causing problems for Kiln.
Now I'm going to upgrade test accounts

[2011-05-31 Tue 09:27 AM]
First, write my weekly kiwi. Then plan my week.

[2011-05-31 Tue 10:10 AM]
Making sure the upgrade service is running on all hb/webny boxes

[2011-05-31 Tue 10:17 AM]
All done with restarting the upgrade service. Now I'm off to fix a heartbeat code review change.

[2011-05-31 Tue 10:32 AM]
Talked with Ben re release schedule, got autobuild-windows updated with latest patches. 
Said hi to all the interns.

[2011-05-31 Tue 10:33 AM]
Going through my 8.5 cases, to see which ones I can backlog/won't fix.

[2011-05-31 Tue 04:57 PM]
Worked on a couple inbox issues today - one with Ben that turned out to be a false alarm, the user was using stored procedures to add cases. Crazy. The second was a perf problem on webny5 that turned out to be emails coming in that html agility pack barfed on because the code was slow. So I put in some perf fixes and voila, it's fast.

[2011-06-01 Wed 09:28 AM]
Just got in. Have two inbox cases to tackle: weird filters and multiple timesheet registrations

[2011-06-01 Wed 12:19 PM]
Weird filters - answered the questions
Multiple timesheet entries - getting closer via code inspection
Also did an interview, the guy didn't do very well, and I smartly cut it off early

[2011-06-01 Wed 01:42 PM]
Did a little random catchup, now I'm working on an image not visible inbox case.

[2011-06-01 Wed 03:39 PM]
Still working on image not visible case

[2011-06-02 Thu 11:48 AM]
More heartbeat emergencies last night and this morning. All of them are related to bugs in HtmlAgilityPack that I've fixed but that we haven't got deployed yet. That's all under control now. Jude's got some good perf fixes for search in and we're testing, but we may release them quicker than we'd like to. Here's hoping they are safe.

[2011-06-02 Thu 01:47 PM]
Talked with Aaron about the interns, sounds like things are going well there. 
Now going through incoming cases

[2011-06-02 Thu 01:49 PM]
That was easy. Now I'm going to go talk to Jude about getting the search changes out quick.

[2011-06-02 Thu 02:18 PM]
Deploying FB to ourdot, so we'll feel better about this evening's release.
While, that's going on, I'm going to fix up our db access in the kiln build scripts

[2011-06-06 Mon 10:29 AM]
Took care of an inbox inquiry already this morning, and have been dealing with old, unimportant bugzscout's. Going to reset my password, and get to work planning my work for the coming weeks so that I'm able to monitor everything that needs to be done.

[2011-06-06 Mon 11:46 AM]
Currently working out my weekly kiwi. 

[2011-06-06 Mon 12:00 PM]
Adjusted the heartbeat thread numbers back to where they were before the last upgrade in hopes of getting us better p1 heartbeat performance.

[2011-06-06 Mon 01:58 PM]
Working through backlogged hosted cases and watching wwdc announcements

[2011-06-07 Tue 09:48 AM]
Got in, working on a script to clear out cases that are for versions that we no longer care about (old hosted versions)

[2011-06-07 Tue 10:58 AM]
Script is done, now I'm back to weekly planning and getting things under control

[2011-06-08 Wed 11:27 AM]
Spent the morning learning about how our mail code hooks up to ssl pop accounts, didn't get very far, but we've sent the case back to the customer.

[2011-06-08 Wed 11:28 AM]
Now back to planning, getting things under control

[2011-06-08 Wed 01:41 PM]
Catching up on undecided cases

[2011-06-09 Thu 09:21 AM]
Clearing out inboxes, getting things in order: my new morning routine. 1 Pomodoro down, 1 to go

[2011-06-09 Thu 09:47 AM]
Ok, I'm all on top of things now. Life is good. Time to sit down with Jude/Aaron/Babak

[2011-06-09 Thu 11:07 AM]
Talked with Aaron
Then merged release+devel to dogfood and back to devel
Now building licensed builds of FogBugz + Kiln 
And off to talk with Babak
